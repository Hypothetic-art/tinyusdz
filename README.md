# Tiny USDZ library 

`TinyUSDZ` is dependency-free(depends only on C++ STL. Other 3rd-party libraries included. Yes, you don't need USD library!) USDZ/USDC/USDA library written in C++14.

## Status

TinyUSDZ is currently work-in-progress. It does not compile and run.
I'm now rewritting TinyUSDZ core to support more USD features including Composition Arcs, Skinning, Animations, Hair strands, etc. Initial working demo in 2022 Summer planned.

* [x] USDC data parse
* [ ] USDA parser
  * Initial USDA parser starting to work(see `src/usda-parser.cc`)
  * Support Blender-exported USDA support in 2022 Fall planned.
* [ ] Reconstuct primitive and scene graph representaion(2022 Summer expected)
  * [ ] GeomMesh
  * [ ] GeomBasisCurves(for hair/fur)
  * [ ] GeomPoints(for particles)
  * [ ] Xform
  * [ ] etc.
  * [ ] Built-in usdObj(wavefront .obj mesh support)
    * See [doc/usdObj.md](doc/usdObj.md) for details.
  * [ ] MagicaVoxel vox for Volume?
  * [ ] VDBVolume support through TinyVDBIO? https://github.com/syoyo/tinyvdbio
* [ ] Composition
  * [ ] subLayers
  * [ ] references
  * [ ] payloads(delayed load)
  * [ ] variants
  * [ ] specializers
* [ ] Write simple SDL viewer example(2022 Summer expected)
* [ ] Character animation(usdSkel, blendshapes, animations) support(2022 Summer expected)
* [ ] Vulkan raytracing viewer example
* [ ] Write iOS and Android example(2022 Fall expected)
* [ ] Polygon triangulation using mapbox/earcut.hpp
* [ ] USDZ(USDC) writer
* [ ] USDA writer
* [ ] USD <-> glTF converter

## Notice

TinyUSDZ does not support Reality Composer file format(`.reality`) since it uses proprietary file format and we cannot understand it(so no conversion support from/to Reality also).

## Commercial support

TinyUSDZ focuses on loading/writing USDA/USDC/USDZ functionalities.
Example viewer is just for demo purpose.
Currently TinyUSDZ project is run as personal project by `syoyo` and `syoyo` does not provide commercial support as an individual.

If you need commercial support, eco-system development(e.g. plug-ins, authorization tools on top of TinyUSDZ) or production-grade USDZ model viewer(e.g. embed TinyUSDZ to your AR app, 3D NFT Android mobile viewer capable of displaying (encrypted) USDZ model), please contact Light Transport Entertainment, Inc. : https://goo.gl/forms/1p6uGcOKWGpXPHkA2

## USDZ file format

USDZ is actually the uncompressed zip file.
USDZ(ZIP) contains usdc(binary) and resources(e.g. image/auduo files)

## Security and memory budget

USDZ(USDC) is a binary format and data are compressed. To avoid out-of-bounds access, out-of-memory, and other security issues when loading malcious USDZ(e.g. USDZ file from unknown origin), TinyUSDZ has a memory budget feature to avoid out-of-memory issue.

To limit a memory usage when loading USDZ file, Please set a value `max_memory_limit_in_mb` in USDLoadOptions.

TinyUSDZ source codes are also checked by Address Sanitizer, CodeQL and Fuzzer.

## Build

### Integrate to your app

Recomended way is simply copy `src` and `include` folder to your app, and add `*.cc` files to your app's build system.

I do not recommend to use tinyusdz as a git submodule, since the repo contains lots of codes required to build TinyUSDZ examples but these are not required for your app.

### Compiler defines

* `TINYUSDZ_USE_OPENSUBDIV` : Use OpenSubviv for subdivision surface(to get smooth mesh from USD(Z) primitive). Default enabled.

### CMake

cmake build is still provided for CI build. `CMakeSettings.json` is provided for Visual Studio 2019.

Cmake project is not recommended for embedding TinyUSDZ to your app.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

#### LLVM-MinGW build

MinGW native and cross-compiling example using llvm-mingw(clang) is provided.
See `scripts/bootstrap-cmake-mingw-win.sh` and `scripts/bootstrap-cmake-llvm-mingw-cross.sh` for details. 

One of benefit to use llvm-mingw is address sanitizer support on Windows app.

To run app(`.exe`, you'll need `libunwind.dll` and `libc++.dll` on your working directory or search path)

For Windows native build, we assume `ninja.exe` is installed on your system(You can use it from Meson package)

#### CMake build options

* `TINYUSDZ_BUILD_TESTS` : Build tests
* `TINYUSDZ_BUILD_EXAMPLES` : Build examples(note that not all examples in `examples` folder are built)
* `TINYUSDZ_WITH_OPENSUBDIV` : Use OpenSubviv to tessellate subdivision surface.
  * OpenSubdiv code is included in TinyUSDZ repo. If you want to use external OpenSubdiv repo, specity the path to OpenSubdiv using `osd_DIR` cmake environment variable.
* `TINYUSDZ_WITH_AUDIO` : Support loading audio(mp3 and wav).
* `TINYUSDZ_WITH_EXR` : Support loading EXR format HDR texture through TinyEXR.
* `TINYUSDZ_WITH_PXR_COMPAT_API` : Build with pxr compatible API.

#### clang-cl on Windows

Assume ninja.exe is installed and path to ninja.exe is added to your `%PATH%`

Edit path to MSVC SDK and Windows SDK in `bootstrap-clang-cl-win64.bat`, then

```
> bootstrap-clang-cl-win64.bat
> ninja.exe
```

### Meson

Meson build is provided for compile tests.

```
$ meson builddir
$ cd builddir
$ ninja
```

### Examples

* [Simple dump](examples/simple_dump/)
* [Simple SDL viewer](examples/sdlviewer/)
  * Separated CMake build : See [Readme](examples/sdlviewer/README.md)

See `examples` directory for more examples.

### Data format

See [prim_format.md](doc/prim_format.md) and [preview_surface.md](doc/preview_surface.md)

## Blender add-on(W.I.P)

Supprted Blender version

* 2.93 LTS(Python 3.9)

### Linux

Edit path to python interpreter in `scripts/bootstrap-cmake-linux-blender-pymodule.sh`, then

```
$ ./scripts/bootstrap-cmake-linux-blender-pymodule.sh
$ cd build
$ make
```

Copy `tinyusd_blender.*-linux-gnu.so` to blender's folder.
Recommended location is `USER` folder(`~/.config/blender/2.xx`)

Create `scripts/addons/modules` folder if required

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/blender/2.93/scripts/addons/modules
```
